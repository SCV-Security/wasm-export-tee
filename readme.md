# wasm-export-tee

This is a collection of bytecodes decompiled from CosmWasm chain to facilitate lookups when a particular string is required!

This idea came right after the Terra IBC incident on 31st July 2024.

In order to track and identify the bad actor, we fetched code_ids from CosmWasm chains and compared them with the known metadata from the exploiter contract dode.

This repo is a WIP.
